; Exercise 2.71.
;
; Suppose we have a Huffman tree for an alphabet of n symbols,
; and that the relative frequencies of the symbols are 1, 2, 4, ..., 2n-1.
; Sketch the tree for n=5; for n=10. In such a tree (for general n) how many
; bits are required to encode the most frequent symbol? the least frequent
; symbol?
; ------------------------------------------------------------

; Tree is easy to scetch.
;
; For the biggest weight symbol, it will take always only 1,
; and for the smallest weight n-1 bits.
