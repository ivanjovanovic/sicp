; Exercise 2.52.
;
; Make changes to the square limit of wave shown in
; figure 2.9 by working at each of the levels described above. In
; particular:

; a.  Add some segments to the primitive wave painter of exercise  2.49
; (to add a smile, for example).

; b.  Change the pattern constructed by corner-split (for example, by
; using only one copy of the up-split and right-split images instead of
; two).

; c.  Modify the version of square-limit that uses square-of-four so as
; to assemble the corners in a different pattern. (For example, you
; might make the big Mr. Rogers look outward from each corner of the
; square.)
