; Exercise 3.36.
;
; Suppose we evaluate the following sequence of
; expressions in the global environment:

; (define a (make-connector))
; (define b (make-connector))
; (set-value! a 10 'user)

; At some time during evaluation of the set-value!, the following
; expression from the connector's local procedure is evaluated:

; (for-each-except setter inform-about-value constraints)

; Draw an environment diagram showing the environment in which the above
; expression is evaluated.
